# gh-pages class boilerplate

Boilerplate for setting up gh-pages for a repo. I'm using it for school.

Usage:
* Pull this down
* Branch your repo (you need a gh-pages branch)
* Copy the two files (index.html and gh-pages.css) into the root of your new branch
* Modify the files and add more elements
* Commit and push the branch
